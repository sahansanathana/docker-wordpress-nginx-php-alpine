* Used in production for many sites, making it stable, tested and up-to-date
* Optimized for 100 concurrent users
* Optimized to only use resources when there's traffic (by using PHP-FPM's ondemand PM)
* Works with Amazon Cloudfront or CloudFlare as SSL terminator and CDN
* Multi-platform, supporting AMD4, ARMv6, ARMv7, ARM64
* Built on the lightweight Alpine Linux distribution
* Small Docker image size (+/-90MB)
